When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I need to share my code with others or when I am in collaboration with others. By commiting to a remote repository,
I can keep my most updated code version reachable to others and get recommendation for improvement. It is also another backup
of my code so I won't panic if I accidentally delete the local version.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There might be others working on the same file. So instead of letting everyone's progress jam up my local git log, I shall want to
keep updated to the online version only when I know what is going on and what commits others have made.
