When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I need to share my code with others or when I am in collaboration with others. By commiting to a remote repository,
I can keep my most updated code version reachable to others and get recommendation for improvement. It is also another backup
of my code so I won't panic if I accidentally delete the local version.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There might be others working on the same file. So instead of letting everyone's progress jam up my local git log, I shall want to
keep updated to the online version only when I know what is going on and what commits others have made.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are online version of a cloned repository, this exists when we want to copy another's repository and share with collaborators to improve. 
Clones are local version of a repository from another Github URL or file location, I would git clone a repository for editing on a local computer.
Branches are the unit each git push/pull operates on and keep track of a feature's history.
